## Sign Protocol

We are using Sign Protocol for -

Attestation Hub Contract for Vehicle Service and Repair Work Orders, Invoices and Reports: We are extending the Sign Protocol to develop the Attestation Hub smart contract for Vehicle Service and Repair Work Orders, Invoices and Reports. We wish to enable vehicle owners to use Sign Protocol for all their vehicle insurance-claim transaction needs and collaborating with Third Party administrators in case of any urgent requirements.

We are also integrating EtherCalc OSS spreadsheet with the Sign Protocol to prepare a list of the verified vehicle service providers with the requisite attestations. Link: https://ethercalc.net/veg1fcob7fe3

We are extending EthSign's template for enabling authorization and signing of invoices and work orders in Eth garage's ecommerce dapp solution.

We are developing Account Abstraction tools using Sign Protocol to support operations like sending DAI and USDC payment amounts, zk signing of the transaction and other cryptographic operations across multiple platforms and blockchains that improve the overall usability and interoperability.


## Arbitrum

We are using Arbitrum and Farcaster to develop Repair NFT badges and marketplace with NFT badges issued to Vehicle Service providers on completion of repair work/vehicle servicing built using Arbitrum Stylus programs in Rust. We are extending the starter template for writing Arbitrum Stylus programs in Rust using the stylus-sdk. It includes a Rust implementation of a basic counter Ethereum smart contract.

## Risc 0 

We are developing a KYC decentralized application using Risc0 ZKVM for vehicle owners and vehicle service providers that allows them to verify and mint their identity as an NFT enabling onchain identity verification with zero-knowledge proofs.

Link: https://github.com/seetadev/EthGarage/tree/main/risc0-foundry-zk-validate/zk-kyc-risc0-vehicle-owners-mechanic

The dapp leverages ID.me to generate a vehicle owner authentication token. The token includes a nonce that is associated with the vehicle owner's connected wallet address, employing principles from the OpenPubkey: Augmenting OpenID Connect with User held Signing Keys paper. The JWT's integrity is then verified within the guest using ID.me's public RS256 signing certificates. The guest then generates a cryptographic proof of the JWT's integrity and issues a receipt. This receipt, containing the SNARK, an obfuscated identifier, and the user's address, can be validated on the onchain for ERC721 token minting or other transactions, if valid.

Vercel link for zk validation: https://zk-validate.vercel.app/

We are also using RISC Zero zkVM and submitting data to Avail DA for weekly work order insights at the vehicle repair/maintenance location.

We are also trying to implement XMTP Chat for vehicle owners and service administrators in a particular region using Risc0 ZKVM with CyberConnect functions. We are enabling interoperability of the Farcaster frames developed with OpenFrames and communicating the vehicle maintenance and billing/invoicing related messages on XMTP. Receipts can also be shared with vehicle owners via XMTP.


## Filecoin 

Filecoin IPC and Filecoin Virtual Machine (FVM) enables us to use building blocks exposed through interfaces, enabling the construction of incident archiving solutions. This improves better outcomes for vehicle maintenance, service and repair. We are using FVM and Filecoin IPC for:

Creating a Vehicle Service Ticket NFT on the FVM for NFC tags of service and repair providers to improve service/repair operations, decentralized NFT-based voting system for contract work by service providers, Votes are uploaded to IPFS with the most recent vote linking to one before.

Filecoin IPC to enable scalability and token bridge operations using ERC20 token supply across multiple platforms and blockchains that improve the overall usability and interoperability.

Decentralized NFT-based voting system for contract work for vehicle service & maintenance providers and companies. DAOs can issue NFTs to wallets based on service and maintenance performance and work completed, and the holders of these NFTs can create proposals and vote on other proposals whilst they have the NFTs of that contract work.

To develop and use composable blocks and ensure effective design, engineering and delivery of a decentralized solution for machine monitoring and incident management using Ethereum & Filecoin eco-system tools. Automated Workflow for decentralized voting for service providers and DAO.

Deployment of DataDAO contracts using FVM testnet and view at Filfox explorer. 

Automated Workflow for decentralized voting for service providers and DAOs:
DAOs create a RFP for providing service or maintenance on the dapp. Service providers can join a RFP by minting an NFT of that RFP. Service providers that have a certain RFP's NFT are eligible to create proposals and vote on them. Voting is gasless and the vote is stored on IPFS and Filecoin with the most recent vote linking to one before.


## Neon EVM  

We are developing a NeonVM utiliy token (Park Pro Token) using Neon transfer SDK, Open Zeppelin and enabling Smart incentivization using both Ethereum and Solana, Gnosis Pay with QR code dapp, EtherCalc.
