# Avail Android Light client lib

We are integrating Availâ€™s Light Client features with Vehicle wallet that seamlessly works across key Ethereum L2 Blockchains and leverages Zero Knowledge Proofs for Crypto-transactions and Identity proofs.

We are also developing custom rollapps with Avail DA and and tools to enable no code, low code analytics tooling using an open source analytics and visualization tool, namely Avail XLS, which enables tabulation, organization, collaboration, visualization, graphing and charting.

1. Take your package name (here it is, Java.com.example.availlibrary.AvailLightClientLib) and compile light client for your package id using the given [steps](https://github.com/availproject/light-client-lib).
2. Place compiled .so files in src/main/jni/arm64-v8a directory in the library.
3. Place header and libc++_shared.so in the same path.
4. Use this library and all its exposed function in your app.
