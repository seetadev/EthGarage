# FEVM-Data-DAO for Vehicle Service and Repair Work at Incident sites

We are extending the beta kit to  build a basic Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) on Filecoin for Vehicle Service and Repair Work at Incident sites.

DAOs create a RFP for providing service or maintenance on the dapp. 

Service providers can join a RFP by minting an NFT of that RFP. 

Service providers that have a certain RFP's NFT are eligible to create proposals and vote on them. 

Voting is gasless and the vote is stored on IPFS and Filecoin with the most recent vote linking to one before.
